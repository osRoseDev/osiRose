You only need to run prose.sql on your database.
list_spawnareas.sql is for the old spawn system, 
and is unused in the newer OSpRose releases.

If you have MySQL installed locally (You need mysql.exe
and mysqldump.exe) then you can run the db_installer.bat
script to install the database tables for you. No need
to edit it, just run it :)
